What is Firefly?
---

Firefly is a Framework built on the Node.js platform.

The aim of this framework is to simplify the enormous complexity that comes with writing larg Node.js projects.

Firefly comes with a very rich API, allowing you to hit the ground running with development instead of worrying about the details.

Firefly comes batteries included to get you started as quickly as possible. But, that doesn't mean you have to use it as is! Any functionality can be be added or modified using the `Service` interface.

Whether you are developing a cool new HTML5 game or a company website, Firefly has you covered.
